| `calorine`     | https://gitlab.com/materials-modeling/calorine | `calorine` is a Python package for running and analyzing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations via GPUMD. It also provides functionality for constructing and sampling neuroevolution potential (NEP) models via GPUMD. |
| `GPUMD-Wizard` | https://github.com/Jonsnow-willow/GPUMD-Wizard | `GPUMD-Wizard` is a material structure processing software based on ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) providing automation capabilities for calculating various properties of metals. Additionally, it aims to run and analyze molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using GPUMD. |
| `gpyumd`       | https://github.com/AlexGabourie/gpyumd         | `gpyumd` is a Python3 interface for GPUMD. It helps users generate input and process output files based on the details provided by the GPUMD documentation. It currently supports up to GPUMD-v3.3.1 and only the gpumd executable. |
| `mdapy`        | https://github.com/mushroomfire/mdapy          | The `mdapy` python library provides an array of powerful, flexible, and straightforward tools to analyze atomic trajectories generated from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. |
