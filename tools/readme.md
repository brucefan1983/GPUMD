## Overview

The `tools` directory contains auxiliary scripts and utilities for tasks such as format conversion, data analysis, structure generation, etc. Hope you find them helpful, but you should use them with caution. If you have questions on a tool, you can try to contact the creator.

## Directory Structure

The tools are grouped into three categories for now:
