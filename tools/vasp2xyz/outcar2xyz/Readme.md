* "singleFrame-outcars2nep-exyz.sh", just read last frame from each "OUTCAR" file to build up "NEP-dataset.xyz". It is thus friendly when building up dataset from VASP single-point calculatios.

* 'multipleFrames-outcars2nep-exyz.sh', read all frames in all "OUTCAR" files to build up "NEP-dataset.xyz". Therefore, it is suitable for trajectories generated by AIMD and relaxation calculations.
