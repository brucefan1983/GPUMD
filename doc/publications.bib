Our calculations showed that the extremely high thermal conductivity of this system at room temperature is dictated by quantum effects. Modal analysis showed that the divergent nature of thermal conductivity, observed in one-dimensional model systems, is suppressed in carbon nanotubes by anharmonic scattering channels provided by the flexural and optical modes with polarization in the plane orthogonal to the transport direction.}

Within the supercell of a moir\'e lattice, different stacking modes generate phonon scattering sites which reduce the thermal conductivity of TBG. The thermal magic angle arises from the competition between the delocalization of atomic vibrational amplitudes and stresses on one hand, and the increased AA stacking density on the other hand. The former effect weakens the scattering strength of a single scatterer while the latter one increases the density of scatterers. The combination of these two effects eventually leads to the apparition of the highlighted irregularity in heat conduction. The manifestation of a magic angle, disclosing new thermal mechanisms at nanoscale, further uncovers the unique physics of two-dimensional materials.},

By contrast, the thermal conductivity in BPF is isotropic and is only 0.45(5) W/mK. We show that the inter-molecular covalent bonding in QHPF plays a crucial role in enhancing the thermal conductivity in QHPF as compared to that in BPF. The heat transport properties as characterized in this work will be useful for the application of QHPF as novel 2D electronic devices.},

Some theoretical studies have suggested that the thermal conductivity of a (10,10) SWCNT is dramatically enhanced by C60 fullerene encapsulation. However, recent experiments on SWCNT bundles show that fullerene encapsulation leads to a reduction rather than an increase in thermal conductivity. Here, we employ three different molecular dynamics methods to study the influence of C60 encapsulation on heat transport in a (10,10) SWCNT. All the three methods consistently predict a reduction of the thermal conductivity of (10,10) SWCNT upon C60 encapsulation by 20\%-30\%, in agreement with experimental results on bundles of SWCNTs. We demonstrate that there is a simulation artifact in the Green-Kubo method which gives anomalously large thermal conductivity from artificial convection. Our results show that the C60 molecules conduct little heat compared to the outer SWCNT and reduce the phonon mean free paths of the SWCNT by inducing extra phonon scattering. We also find that the thermal conductivity of a (10,10) SWCNT monotonically decreases with increasing filling ratio of C60 molecules.},

Here we give an in-depth comparison of them in terms of heat transport in three allotropes of Si: three-dimensional bulk silicon, two-dimensional silicene, and quasi-one-dimensional silicon nanowire. By multiplying the correlation time in the Green-Kubo formula with an appropriate effective group velocity, we can express the running thermal conductivity in the EMD method as a function of an effective length and directly compare it to the length-dependent thermal conductivity in the NEMD method. We find that the two methods quantitatively agree with each other for all the systems studied, firmly establishing their equivalence in computing thermal conductivity.},

In such systems the heat current autocorrelation function develops negative values after a correlation time which is proportional to the length of the simulation cell in the transport direction. Accordingly, the running thermal conductivity develops a maximum value at the same correlation time and eventually decays to zero. By comparing EMD with nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations, we conclude that the maximum thermal conductivity from EMD in a system with domain length 2L is equal to the thermal conductivity from NEMD in a system with domain length L. This facilitates the use of nonperiodic-boundary EMD for thermal transport in finite samples in close correspondence to NEMD.}

In this paper, the machine learning (ML) method together with molecular dynamics simulations is employed to study the thermal transport property of C\textendash BNHCs, and also utilized to design the structures of C\textendash BNHCs for the specific thermal conductivity. Our forward learning study reveals a big difference in the thermal conductivities of C\textendash BNHCs with the same BNHC doping level but different doping arrangements. Meanwhile, a nonmonotonic relation is observed between the thermal conductivity of C\textendash BNHCs and their doping concentration, which, according to our analyses of the phonon density of states and spectral thermal conductivity, is attributed to the complicated phonon scattering behaviors in C\textendash BNHCs. In addition, our ML-based method exhibits the high accuracy and efficiency in the inverse design of C\textendash BNHCs with any specific thermal conductivity. Moreover, as for a target thermal conductivity, the present ML-based inverse design method can output numerous potential optimal structures at once for C\textendash BNHCs, which will greatly shorten the design period of C\textendash BNHCs.},

One effective strategy is to utilize superatoms as building blocks to introduce hierarchical bonding and vibration for suppressing phonon velocity and enhancing high-order scattering. However, far fewer theoretical efforts have been made to understand the lattice dynamics and thermal transport in superatom-based materials. Herein, different from most of the existing works reported hitherto on atom-superatom hybrid systems, we carry out a comprehensive study on the phonon interaction and thermal transport in superatomic crystal PH4AlBr4 solely consisting of superatoms (superalkali and superhalogen), by employing homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics with active-learning potential, combined with density functional theory and unified theory of phonon thermal transport. We find that the supersalt PH4AlBr4 crystal exhibits amorphouslike ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.329-0.286Wm-1K-1 from 200 to 600 K. In particular, due to the strong quartic anharmonicity, the contribution of four-phonon scattering reaches 38\% of total scattering rates at 300 K, while the phonon coherence's contribution is comparable with that of population, resulting from significant phonon localization. These theoretical findings demonstrate that superatom-assembled materials exhibit features distinguished from atom-based crystals and provide a unique platform for exploring ultralow thermal conductivity with enhanced two-channel thermal transport.}

In this work, we employ extensive molecular dynamics simulations to study thermal transport in large suspended polycrystalline graphene samples. Samples of different controlled grain sizes are prepared by a recently developed efficient multiscale approach based on the phase field crystal model. In contrast to previous works, our results show that the scaling of the thermal conductivity with the grain size implies bimodal behavior with two effective Kapitza lengths. The scaling is dominated by the out-of-plane (flexural) phonons with a Kapitza length that is an order of magnitude larger than that of the in-plane phonons. We also show that, to get quantitative agreement with the most recent experiments, quantum corrections need to be applied to both the Kapitza conductance of grain boundaries and the thermal conductivity of pristine graphene, and the corresponding Kapitza lengths must be renormalized accordingly.}

Based on this force formula, a stress applicable for periodic systems can be unambiguously defined. The force formula can then be used to derive the heat current formulas using a natural potential partitioning. Our heat current formulation is found to be equivalent to most of the seemingly different heat current formulas used in the literature, but to deviate from the stress-based formula derived from two-body potential.

In this paper, we develop a highly efficient molecular dynamics code fully implemented on graphics processing units for thermal conductivity calculations using the Green\textendash Kubo formula. We compare two different schemes for force evaluation, a previously used thread-scheme, where a single thread is used for one particle and each thread calculates the total force for the corresponding particle, and a new block-scheme, where a whole block is used for one particle and each thread in the block calculates one or several pair forces between the particle associated with the given block and its neighbor particle(s) associated with the given thread. For both schemes, two different classical potentials, namely, the Lennard-Jones potential and the rigid-ion potential are implemented. While the thread-scheme performs a little better for relatively large systems, the block-scheme performs much better for relatively small systems. The relative performance of the block-scheme over the thread-scheme also increases with the increasing cutoff radius. We validate the implementation by calculating lattice thermal conductivities of solid argon and lead telluride. The efficiency of our code makes it very promising to study thermal conductivity properties of more complicated materials, especially, materials with interesting nanostructures.},

  abstract = {We present GPUQT, a quantum transport code fully implemented on graphics processing units. Using this code, one can obtain intrinsic electronic transport properties of large systems described by a real-space tight-binding Hamiltonian together with one or more types of disorder. The DC Kubo conductivity is represented as a time integral of the velocity auto-correlation or a time derivative of the mean square displacement. Linear scaling (with respect to the total number of orbitals in the system) computation time and memory usage are achieved by using various numerical techniques, including sparse matrix\textendash vector multiplication, random phase approximation of trace, Chebyshev expansion of quantum evolution operator, and kernel polynomial method for quantum resolution operator. We describe the inputs and outputs of GPUQT and give a few examples to demonstrate its usage, paying attention to the interpretations of the results.

  abstract = {Silicon is an important material and many empirical interatomic potentials have been developed for atomistic simulations of it. Among them, the Tersoff potential and its variants are the most popular ones. However, all the existing Tersoff-like potentials fail to reproduce the experimentally measured thermal conductivity of diamond silicon. Here we propose a modified Tersoff potential and develop an efficient open source code called GPUGA (graphics processing units genetic algorithm) based on the genetic algorithm and use it to fit the potential parameters against energy, virial and force data from quantum density functional theory calculations. This potential, which is implemented in the efficient open source GPUMD (graphics processing units molecular dynamics) code, gives significantly improved descriptions of the thermal conductivity and phonon dispersion of diamond silicon as compared to previous Tersoff potentials and at the same time well reproduces the elastic constants. Furthermore, we find that quantum effects on the thermal conductivity of diamond silicon at room temperature are non-negligible but small: using classical statistics underestimates the thermal conductivity by about 10\% as compared to using quantum statistics.},

We also detail our efficient implementation of the NEP approach in graphics processing units as well as our workflow for the construction of NEP models and demonstrate their application in large-scale atomistic simulations. By comparing to state-of-the-art MLPs, we show that the NEP approach not only achieves above-average accuracy but also is far more computationally efficient. These results demonstrate that the gpumd package is a promising tool for solving challenging problems requiring highly accurate, large-scale atomistic simulations. To enable the construction of MLPs using a minimal training set, we propose an active-learning scheme based on the latent space of a pre-trained NEP model. Finally, we introduce three separate Python packages, viz., gpyumd, calorine, and pynep, that enable the integration of gpumd into Python workflows.}

Since the HNEMD method is homogeneous without boundary scattering, we obtain more accurate results than previous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics studies. Through intensive simulations, the main findings of the paper are as follows. (1) We find an efficient simulation setting, yielding results which are in good agreement with the experimental data; (2) Although the increase of the system size and the extension of production period has a beneficial effect to obtain more convergent results, these lead to large discrepancy with the experimental data; (3) The thermal conductivity is reduced by the phonon scattering among graphene layers; (4) The spectral decomposition of thermal conductivity shows that the bilayer graphene retains the spectrum of its monolayer counterpart except for the increasing magnitudes; (5) The spectral phonon mean free path of bilayer graphene reveals the presence of a new phonon mode which may have a negative contribution to the thermal conductivity.},

  abstract = {Thermal transport by phonons in films with thicknesses of less than 10 nm is investigated in a soft system (Lennard-Jones argon) and a stiff system (Tersoff silicon) using two-dimensional lattice dynamics calculations and the Boltzmann transport equation. This approach uses a unit cell that spans the film thickness, which removes approximations related to the finite cross-plane dimension required in typical three-dimensional-based approaches. Molecular dynamics simulations, which make no assumptions about the nature of the thermal transport, are performed to obtain finite-temperature structures for the lattice dynamics calculations and to predict thermal conductivity benchmarks. Thermal conductivity decreases with decreasing film thickness for both the two-dimensional lattice dynamics calculations and the MD simulations, until the thickness reaches four unit cells (2.1 nm) for argon and three unit cells (1.6 nm) for silicon. With a further decrease in film thickness, thermal conductivity plateaus in argon while it increases in silicon. This unexpected behavior, which we identify as a signature of phonon confinement, is a result of an increased contribution from low-frequency phonons, whose density of states increases as the film thickness decreases. Phonon mode-level analysis suggests that confinement effects emerge below thicknesses of ten unit cells (5.3 nm) for argon and six unit cells (3.2 nm) for silicon. These transition points both correspond to approximately twenty atomic layers. Thermal conductivity predictions based on the bulk (i.e., three-dimensional) phonon properties combined with a boundary scattering model do not capture the low thickness behavior. To match the two-dimensional lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics predictions for larger thicknesses, the three-dimensional lattice dynamics calculations require a finite specularity parameter that in some cases approaches unity. These findings point to the challenges associated with interpreting experimental thermal conductivity measurements of ultrathin silicon films, where surface roughness and a native oxide layer impact phonon transport.}

Here, we compare the thermal conductivity (TC) and thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of monolayer MoS2 on amorphous (a-) and crystalline (c-) SiO2, AlN, Al2O3, and h-BN monolayers using molecular dynamics. The room temperature, in-plane TC of MoS2 is {$\sim$}38\,Wm-1\,K-1 on amorphous substrates and up to {$\sim$}68\,Wm-1\,K-1 on crystalline substrates, with most of the difference due to substrate interactions with long-wavelength MoS2 phonons (\&lt;2\,THz). An h-BN monolayer used as a buffer between MoS2 and the substrate causes the MoS2 TC to increase by up to 50\%. Length-dependent calculations reveal TC size effects below {$\sim$}2\,{$\mu$}m and show that the MoS2 TC is not substrate- but size-limited below {$\sim$}100\,nm. We also find that the TBC of MoS2 with c-Al2O3 is over twice that with c-AlN despite a similar MoS2 TC on both, indicating that the TC and TBC could be tuned independently. Finally, we compare the thermal resistance of MoS2 transistors on all substrates and find that MoS2 TBC is the most important parameter for heat removal for long-channel (\&gt;150\,nm) devices, while TBC and TC are equally important for short channels.

However, while it is known that mobility and thermal conductivity (TC) of graphene are reduced on a substrate, these effects are much less explored in 2D semiconductors such as MoS2. Here, we use molecular dynamics to understand TC changes in monolayer (1L) and bilayer (2L) MoS2 by comparing suspended, supported, and encased structures. The TC of monolayer MoS2 is reduced from {$\sim$}117 W m-1 K-1 when suspended, to {$\sim$}31 W m-1 K-1 when supported by SiO2, at 300 K. Encasing 1L MoS2 in SiO2 further reduces its TC down to {$\sim$}22 W m-1 K-1. In contrast, the TC of 2L MoS2 is not as drastically reduced, being {$>$}50\% higher than 1L both when supported and encased. These effects are due to phonon scattering with remote vibrational modes of the substrate, which are partly screened in 2L MoS2. We also examine the TC of 1L MoS2 across a wide range of temperatures (300 K to 700 K) and defect densities (up to 5 \texttimes{} 1013 cm-2), finding that the substrate reduces the dependence of TC on these factors. Taken together, these are important findings for all applications which will use 2D semiconductors supported or encased by insulators, instead of freely suspended.},

Accordingly, effective approaches are needed to optimize interfacial thermal transport. In this work, by combining the molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning technique, we systematically study the optimization of interfacial thermal transport in Si/Ge heterostructures through interfacial nanostructuring. Three structural parameters are proposed to describe the nanostructures at interfaces and applied to the machine learning driven predictions. The results demonstrate that the interfacial thermal transport significantly depends on the interfacial nanostructures and diverse guidances are discovered for the optimization. When fixing the density of nanostructures, the interfacial thermal resistance has a minimum at specific heights of nanostructures with small angles, while the minimum is gradually disappeared for the nanostructures with larger angles. When fixing the height of nanostructures, there is also a minimum versus density but gradually disappeared with increasing angles. The nonmonotonic dependences on density and height open spaces for the optimization of interfacial thermal transport. Our spectral decomposition analysis provides physical insights into machine learning predictions and optimizations. Finally, we also summarize the machine learning predictions from the perspective of contact area, in which the distinct dependencies on nanostructuring angle and height manifest the feasibility for the further optimization of interfacial thermal transport.

Recent innovations include the development of materials with thermal conduction anisotropy, which can remove hotspots along the fast-axis direction and provide thermal insulation along the slow axis4,5. However, most artificially engineered thermal conductors have anisotropy ratios much smaller than those seen in naturally anisotropic materials. Here we report extremely anisotropic thermal conductors based on large-area van der Waals thin films with random interlayer rotations, which produce a room-temperature thermal anisotropy ratio close to 900 in MoS2, one of the highest ever reported. This is enabled by the interlayer rotations that impede the through-plane thermal transport, while the~long-range intralayer crystallinity maintains high in-plane thermal conductivity. We measure ultralow thermal conductivities in the through-plane direction for MoS2 (57\,{$\pm$}\,3\,mW\,m-1\,K-1) and WS2 (41\,{$\pm$}\,3\,mW\,m-1\,K-1) films, and we quantitatively explain these values using molecular dynamics simulations that reveal one-dimensional glass-like thermal transport. Conversely, the in-plane thermal conductivity in these MoS2 films is close to the single-crystal value. Covering nanofabricated gold electrodes with our anisotropic films prevents overheating of the electrodes and blocks heat from reaching the device surface.

The {$\kappa$} of 5FT-DNWs is effectively enhanced by the defects of 5FT boundaries, and non-monotonically changes with the cross-sectional area (S).

On the basis of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, the thermal transport in pristine and resonant Si-membranes bounded with \{100\}, \{110\} and \{111\} facets is investigated. It is found that the creation of surfaces can introduce anisotropic thermal transport due to the lattice symmetry breaking. Besides, ballistic phonon transport is found in pristine membranes with lengths up to ~500 nm at low-frequencies with a critical frequency mainly dependent on the crystallographic orientation. Moreover, although surface resonances can dramatically reduce the thermal conductivity of all membranes, the resonant effect strongly relies on membrane orientation. Among the three studied membrane orientations, the resonant effect is maximized in the \{111\}-membrane, where the thermal conductivity is tuned from the largest one to the smallest one among the three membrane types by resonant pillars. The large thermal conductivity reduction in the \{111\}-membranes by resonances originated from the reduced spectral heat flux between 3 and 12 THz. Furthermore, the resonant coupling strength can be tuned by the interface vacancy between resonant pillars and the base material, which can enhance phonon transport at an intermediate frequency range.

We find that the thermal conductivity of a-Si1-xGex as a function of x exhibits a smoother U shape than in crystalline mass-disordered alloys. The main contribution to the initial drop of thermal conductivity at low Ge concentration stems from the localization of otherwise extended modes that make up the lowest 8\% of the population by frequency. Contributions from intermediate frequency modes are decreased more gradually with increasing Ge to reach a broad minimum thermal conductivity between concentrations of Ge from x=0.25 to 0.75. Modal analysis unravels the correlations among localization, line broadening, and the contribution to thermal transport of modes within different frequency ranges.}

  abstract = {For centuries, cutting and folding papers with special patterns have been used to build beautiful, flexible and complex three-dimensional structures. Inspired by the old idea of kirigami (paper cutting), and the outstanding properties of graphene, recently graphene kirigami structures were fabricated to enhance the stretchability of graphene. However, the possibility of further tuning the electronic and thermal transport along the 2D kirigami structures has remained original to investigate. We therefore performed extensive atomistic simulations to explore the electronic, heat and load transfer along various graphene kirigami structures. The mechanical response and thermal transport were explored using classical molecular dynamics simulations. We then used a real-space Kubo\textendash Greenwood formalism to investigate the charge transport characteristics in graphene kirigami. Our results reveal that graphene kirigami structures present highly anisotropic thermal and electrical transport. Interestingly, we show the possibility of tuning the thermal conductivity of graphene by four orders of magnitude. Moreover, we discuss the engineering of kirigami patterns to further enhance their stretchability by more than 10 times as compared with pristine graphene. Our study not only provides a general understanding concerning the engineering of electronic, thermal and mechanical response of graphene, but more importantly can also be useful to guide future studies with respect to the synthesis of other 2D material kirigami structures, to reach highly flexible and stretchable nanostructures with finely tunable electronic and thermal properties.},

We accordingly conducted density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the mechanical/failure, thermal conductivity and stability, electronic and optical properties of three N-graphdiyne nanomembranes. Our DFT results of uniaxial tensile simulations reveal that these monolayers can yield remarkably high stretchability or tensile strength depending on the atomic structure and loading direction. Studied N-graphdiyne nanomembranes were found to exhibit semiconducting electronic character, with band-gap values ranging from 0.98\,eV to 3.33\,eV, based on the HSE06 estimations. The first absorption peak suggests that these 2D structures can absorb visible, IR and NIR light. Ab initio molecular dynamics results reveal that N-graphdiyne 2D structures can withstand at high temperatures, like 2000 K. Thermal conductivities of suspended single-layer N-graphdiyne sheets were predicted to be almost temperature independent and about three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the graphene. The comprehensive insight provided by this work highlights the outstanding physics of N-graphdiyne 2D nanomaterials, and suggest them as highly promising candidates for the design of novel stretchable nanodevices.},

The reemergent MgO-H2O compounds are: Mg2O3H2 above 400\,GPa, MgO3H4 above 600\,GPa, and MgO4H6 in the pressure range of 270\textendash 600\,GPa.

Our results suggest that a substantial amount of water can be stored in MgO rock in the deep interiors of Earth to Neptune mass planets. Based on molecular dynamics simulations we show that these three compounds exhibit superionic behavior at the pressure-temperature conditions as in the interiors of Uranus and Neptune. Moreover, the water-rich compound MgO4H6 could be stable inside the early Earth and therefore may serve as a possible early Earth water reservoir. Our findings, in the poorly explored megabar pressure regime, provide constraints for interior and evolution models of wet planets in our solar system and beyond.},

The temperature profile and inter- and intra-layer heat fluxes of the BL-ML graphene indicated that, there is no fully developed thermal equilibrium between layers and the drop in the average temperature profile at the step-like BL-ML interface is not attributable to the effect of Kapitza resistance. By increasing the length of the system up to 1\,{$\mu$}m in the studied MD simulations, the thermally non-equilibrium region was reduced to a small area near the step-like interface. All MD results were compared to a continuum model and a good match was observed between the two approaches.

In general, thermal transport properties highly rely on the characteristic of nanostructures. Thus, understanding the impact of structural characteristics on physical properties is essential for the design of high-performance materials. In this study, we report our results from three different methods including non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, homogeneous non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, and spectral heat current decomposition to explore the phonon thermal transport properties in different graphene/h-BN superlattice monolayers, which are constructed by periodically stitched and equal-sized graphene and h-BN superlattices. We find that the thermal conductivities decrease first and then increase with the increase of periodic length, corresponding to a transition from coherent transport to incoherent transport, and a minimum thermal conductivity at a certain period is identified. These results provide a theoretical validation of a possible control on thermal properties at the nanoscale, which may have potential applications in thermoelectric devices once upon experimental validation.},

Herein, it is imperative to have a clear and comprehensive understanding of the thermal properties of 2D PbTe monolayers, as this is critical for their practical applications. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely employed to predict physical properties at the microscopic scale and are particularly suitable for evaluating phonon thermal conductivity. Generally, predicting the thermal conductivity of 2D materials is a routine task through MD simulations when appropriate interatomic potentials exist. However, the existing interatomic potential for PbTe allotropes is not suitable for their 2D derivatives. In this paper, we develop an efficient machine-learned potential (MLP) based on a newly developed MLP model called neuroevolution potential to build a specific potential for 2D PbTe monolayers. Then, by using this potential, we report the thermal conductivity of 2D PbTe monolayers at different temperatures and under different biaxial strains. Surprisingly, we find an abnormal increase of thermal conductivity with the increase of the biaxial strain due to the enhancement of low-frequency phonons. We hope these results can play a guiding role in their practical use once upon experimental validation.},

Thus, seeking the thermal transport properties of 2D carbon nitrides is of great significance for improving the performance and reliability in practical applications. However, the experimental measurements for 2D materials are limited by various conditions, and the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are quite different, e.g., the calculation results of thermal conductivity of C3N show a poor consistency. To this end, the characteristics of thermal transportation of 2D carbon-nitride nanostructures with the representatives of C3N, C2N, C3N4s(s-triazine), and C3N4t(t-triazine) are comprehensively investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using four different methods. The thermal conductivity of C3N is up to around 866Wm-1K-1 while that of C3N4t is down to around 19Wm-1K-1 in this work. Through spectral heat current (SHC) and phonon analysis, we find that the decrease of thermal conductivity for 2D carbon nitrides is due to the deterioration of out-of-plane thermal conductivity induced by regularly distributed holes and absence of CC bonds. The results show that the rate of heat tranfer in two-dimensional carbon-nitride nanostructures significantly relies on their nanostructures.},

The key physical parameters related to mechanical properties, including Poisson's ratio, elastic modulus, tensile strength and critical strain, were revealed.

The fracture behavior predicted using NEP-based MD simulations in a large supercell containing 20 000 atoms could be verified using DFT.

Phonon resonance in pillared low-dimensional structures has been suggested to be a feasible approach to reduce thermal conductivity (TC). In this work, we study the effects of imperfections in pillared nanostructures based on graphene nanoribbons (GNR), using classical molecular dynamics simulations and harmonic lattice dynamics. The TC of perfect pillared GNR is only about 13\% of that of pristine GNR due to the strong phonon resonant hybridization in pillared GNR. However, introducing imperfections such as vacancy defects and mass mismatch between the pillars and the base material, and alloy disorder in the pillars, can weaken the resonant hybridization and abnormally increase the TC. We show that both vacancy defects and mass mismatch can reduce the penetration of the resonant modes from the pillars into the base material, while the alloy disorder in the pillars can scatter the phonons inside them, which turns regular resonance into a random one with weaker hybridization. Our work provides useful insight into the phonon resonance mechanisms in experimentally relevant low dimensional nanostructures containing various imperfections.},

Theoretical prediction of the thermal conductivity of a-Si in a wide range of temperatures and sample sizes is still a challenge. Herein we present a systematic investigation of the thermal transport properties of a-Si by employing large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an accurate and efficient machine learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) trained against abundant reference data calculated at the quantum-mechanical density-functional-theory level. The high efficiency of NEP allows us to study the effects of finite size and quenching rate in the formation of a-Si in great detail. We find that a simulation cell up to 64000 atoms (a cubic cell with a linear size of 11 nm) and a quenching rate down to 1011 K s-1 are required for almost convergent thermal conductivity. Structural properties, including short- and medium-range order as characterized by the pair-correlation function, angular-distribution function, coordination number, ring statistics, and structure factor are studied to demonstrate the accuracy of NEP and to further evaluate the role of quenching rate. Using both the heterogeneous and homogeneous nonequilibrium MD methods and the related spectral decomposition techniques, we calculate the temperature- and thickness-dependent thermal conductivity values of a-Si and show that they agree well with available experimental results from 10 K to room temperature. Our results also highlight the importance of quantum effects in the calculated thermal conductivity and support the quantum-correction method based on the spectral thermal conductivity.}

Here, we perform a rigorous quantitative comparison of the thermal conductivity obtained from molecular dynamics simulations and phonon Boltzmann transport equations, taking graphene as an example. We observe a generally increasing trend in thermal conductivity when the pore size increases from point defect to nanopore, due to a transition from Rayleigh scattering to geometric scattering and reduced boundary density. The thermal conductivity further converges to the diffusive limit for macropores because of the dominant effect of phonon-phonon scattering over phonon-boundary scattering. Moreover, we identify a critical interpore distance for the crossover from dependent to independent phonon-pore scattering and a critical pore size for the crossover from point defect scattering to boundary scattering.

In the Graphene/h-BN vdW superlattice, we have found the wave-particle crossover of phonon transport, which is reflected in the transition from incoherent to coherent regime as the interface density increases. The analysis reveals that the increased thermal conductivity owing to coherent transport effects will amply compensate for the progressively increasing interface phonon scattering throughout this process. In addition, due to the stronger effects of the above two aspects, the superlattices with higher interface density are more sensitive to changes in temperature and interface coupling strength, which are manifested in the rate of change in thermal conductivity caused by their alteration, respectively.

  abstract = {The emergence of two-dimensional empty space (2D-ES) not only enriches the means of van der Waals integration, but also provides a new and reliable solution for structural design-driven performance modulation. Here, by applying the concept of 2D-ES-based periodic structure design to multilayer graphene, the large-range tunable in-plane anisotropic phonon thermal transport behavior was discovered by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Through a series of in-depth frequency-dependent and in-and-out of plane decomposition phonon analysis, it is found that 2D-ES and its interfaces with different periodic properties exhibit exactly opposite effects on phonon thermal transport along two in-plane orientations, which is the fundamental reason for the existence of the above-mentioned anisotropic thermal transport and its modulation. These findings provide new insights into the realization of in-plane anisotropic thermal transport in quasi-2D materials, which may further inspire novel thermal management strategies.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) lateral superlattices, a typical artificial nano-phononic crystal, have stimulated widespread interests and potential application prospects in terms of their physically interesting features. Herein, we have found wave-particle crossover of phonon transport in the graphene (Gr)/2D polyaniline (C3N) lateral superlattices, which is an indication of a transition in the phonon transport mechanism from the incoherent to coherent regime. Due to the high structural similarity of C3N to Gr, the thermal conductivity of the Gr/C3N lateral superlattice can achieve an ultra-wide modulation range of about 500{$\sim$}1100~W~m-1~K-1, which is far beyond that of other superlattices. The analysis shows that an increase of the interface density will on the one hand weaken the thermal conductivity by increasing phonon-interface scattering, and on the other hand increase it by lowering the phonon transport barriers and allowing more long-wavelength phonons to participate in the transport. This determines the parabolic trend of thermal conductivity containing the minimum, and also reflects the dual effects of hetero-interfaces on phonon thermal transport. In addition, phonon calculations show that the above variation in thermal conductivity is entirely attributable to differences in the phonon mean free path for different interface densities and is not related to their group velocity.},

Two existing parameterizations of the Stillinger\textendash Weber (SW) potential for SLBP are used. Consistent results are obtained for all the three methods and conflicting results from previous MD simulations are critically assessed. Among the three methods, the HNEMD method is the most and the NEMD method the least efficient. The thermal conductivity values from our MD simulations are about an order of magnitude larger than the most recent predictions obtained using the Boltzmann transport equation approach considering long-range interactions in density functional theory calculations, suggesting that the short-range SW potential might be inadequate for describing the phonon anharmonicity in SLBP.},

  abstract = {Thermal properties of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have recently attracted attention related to fundamentals of heat propagation in strongly anisotropic materials, and in the context of potential applications to optoelectronics and thermoelectrics. Multiple empirical potentials have been developed for classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of this material, but it has been unclear which provides the most realistic results. Here, we calculate lattice thermal conductivity of single- and multilayer pristine MoS2 by employing three different thermal transport MD methods: equilibrium, nonequilibrium, and homogeneous nonequilibrium ones. We mainly use the Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics code for numerical calculations, and the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator code for crosschecks. Using different methods and computer codes allows us to verify the consistency of our results and facilitate comparisons with previous studies, where different schemes have been adopted. Our results using variants of the Stillinger-Weber potential are at odds with some previous ones and we analyze the possible origins of the discrepancies in detail. We show that, among the potentials considered here, the reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential gives the most reasonable predictions of thermal transport properties as compared to experimental data. With the REBO potential, we further find that isotope scattering has only a small effect on thermal conduction in MoS2 and the in-plane thermal conductivity decreases with increasing layer number and saturates beyond about three layers. We identify the REBO potential as a transferable empirical potential for MD simulations of MoS2 which can be used to study thermal transport properties in more complicated situations such as in systems containing defects or engineered nanoscale features. This work establishes a firm foundation for understanding heat transport properties of MoS2 using MD simulations.}

  abstract = {Machine learning has become an excellent tool for scientists and engineers to predict, design, and fabricate next-generation material. Here, we report the thermal conductivity and thermal rectification of gradient-nano-grained graphene (GNGG) by molecular dynamic simulation with machine learning. It is revealed that the thermal conductivity of GNGG is mainly determined by the average grain size, while its thermal rectification factor varies linearly with the gradient of nanograins. Deep neural network-based machine learning models are developed to estimate the thermal transport properties of GNGG using microstructural signatures, such as the location, number, and orientation of 5|7 pairs. The results stress the pivotal roles of 5|7 defects in the planar thermal transports of graphene and indicate that high-performance 2D thermal rectifiers for heat flow control and energy harvesting can be achieved by bio-inspired gradient structure engineering. The findings are expected to supply a theoretical strategy for the design of bio-inspired materials and create a method to predict the potential properties of the material candidates by using machine learning, which can save the abundant expense of developing the material by using the classical method.}

The elastic properties and fracture behaviors of monolayer qHPF are found to be strongly anisotropic due to the different properties between the inter-fullerene C\textendash C single bonds and [2 + 2] cycloaddition bonds. Moreover, the tensile strength and fracture strain of monolayer qHPF are much smaller than those of any other existing two-dimensional (2D) carbon crystals. The very small tensile strength or fracture strain is ascribed to the inhomogeneous deformation of the stretched monolayer qHPF, which originates from the stiffness difference between the soft inter-fullerene bonds and the rigid intra-fullerene bonds. Compared with DFT calculations at the ground state, the NEP-based extensive MD simulations predict a much smaller tensile strength and fracture strain for monolayer qHPF due to their consideration of the effects of temperature and membrane size. Our work not only reveals the underlying mechanism of the fracture behaviors of monolayer fullerene networks from an atomistic perspective, but also shows the effectiveness and accuracy of the NEP approach in determining the mechanical properties of 2D materials in the realistic situations.},

This novel two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope has potentials in applications of lithium storage and carbon-based circuitry. Understanding the thermal transport properties of biphenylene network is of critical importance for the performance and reliability of its practical applications. To this end, the thermal transport in biphenylene network is comprehensively investigated in this paper with the aid of molecular dynamics simulations together with first-principles calculations. For the sake of comparison, the thermal conductivities of other 2D sp2-hybridized carbon allotropes including graphene and pentaheptite are also investigated using the same method. It is found that the thermal conductivities of biphenylene network and pentaheptite are, respectively, only about one-thirteenth and one-eighth of graphene. Through the analysis of phonon property, mechanical property and electron density distribution, it is demonstrated that the great reduction in the thermal conductivity of biphenylene network and pentaheptite arises from the decline in their structural symmetry, which leads to the decrease of phonon group velocity and the reduction of phonon mean free path.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus has diverse chemical bonds, and even in its two-dimensional form, there are three stable allotropes: black phosphorene (Black-P), blue phosphorene (Blue-P), and violet phosphorene (Violet-P). Due to the complexity of these structures, no efficient and accurate classical interatomic potential has been developed for them. In this paper, we develop an efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential model for these allotropes and apply it to study thermal transport in them via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Based on the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD method, the thermal conductivities are predicted to be 12.5{$\pm$}0.2 (Black-P in armchair direction), 78.4{$\pm$}0.4 (Black-P in zigzag direction), 128{$\pm$}3 (Blue-P), and 2.36{$\pm$}0.05 (Violet-P) Wm-1K-1. The underlying reasons for the significantly different thermal conductivity values in these allotropes are unraveled through spectral decomposition, phonon eigenmodes, and phonon participation ratio. Under external tensile strain, the thermal conductivity in black-P and violet-P are finite, while that in blue-P appears unbounded due to the linearization of the flexural phonon dispersion that increases the phonon mean free paths in the zero-frequency limit.},

These excitations are characterized by a wide distribution of lifetimes and coherence times expressing particlelike and wavelike natures. In agreement with direct simulations, our theoretical derivation yields a generalized law for the decay of the phonon number taking into account coherent effects. Before the conventional exponential decay due to phonon-phonon scattering, this law introduces a delay proportional to the square of the coherence time. This additional regime leads to a moderate increase of the relaxation times and to a different dependence of phonon relaxation to those. This work opens new horizons in the understanding of the origin and the treatment of thermal phonons.}

With increasing isotope doping, however, the critical size in minimizing the {$\kappa$} is moved to small values because the phonon impurity scattering caused by isotope doping is critically involved. Moreover, there is a critical isotope doping ({$<$}50\%) in the critical size motion, originating from that, above which, the critical size no longer moves due to the persistence of hydrodynamic phonon flow. This study provides new insights into the thermal transport behaviors of quasi-1D structures.},
