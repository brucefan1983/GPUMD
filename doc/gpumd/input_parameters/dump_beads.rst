:attr:`dump_beads`
==================

Write some data (positions and optionally velocities and forces) into `beads_dump_<k>.xyz` in `extended XYZ format <https://github.com/libAtoms/extxyz>`_, where `<k>` runs from 0 to `number_of_beads - 1` as set in a run related to path-integral molecular dynamics (:term:`PIMD`).
Each file thus contains the data for one bead and the format is identical to the :ref:`dump.xyz output file <dump_xyz>` as generated by the :ref:`dump_exyz keyword <kw_dump_exyz>`. 

Caveats
-------

* The centroid data (the average over all the beads) for the ring polymer in PIMD-related runs are still output by the :ref:`dump_exyz keyword <kw_dump_exyz>`. 

* This keyword should not be used in a run not related to PIMD.
