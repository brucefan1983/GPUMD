   single: ensemble (keyword in run.in)

:attr:`ensemble`
================

This keyword is used to set up an integration method (an integrator).
Background information pertaining to the representation of different ensembles in :term:`MD` simulations can be found :ref:`here <ensembles>`.


Syntax
------

The number of optional parameters depends on the first parameter, which can assume any of the following values::

    nve
    nvt_ber
    nvt_nhc
    nvt_bdp
    nvt_lan
    nvt_bao
    npt_ber
    npt_scr
    heat_nhc
    heat_bdp
    heat_lan

:attr:`nve`
^^^^^^^^^^^
If the first parameter is :attr:`nve`, it means that the ensemble for the current run is NVE (micro-canonical).
There is no need to further specify any other parameters. Therefore, the full command is::

    ensemble nve

:attr:`nvt_ber`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the first parameter is :attr:`nvt_ber`, it means that the ensemble for the current run is NVT (canonical) generated by using the :ref:`Berendsen method <berendsen_thermostat>`.
In this case, one needs to specify an initial target temperature :attr:`T_1`, a final target temperature :attr:`T_2`, and a parameter :attr:`T_coup`, which reflects the strength of the coupling between the system and the thermostat. The full command is::

    ensemble nvt_ber T_1 T_2 T_coup
 
The target temperature (not the instant system temperature) will vary linearly from :attr:`T_1` to :attr:`T_2` during a run.
The choice of :attr:`T_coup` is discussed :ref:`below <choice_of_parameters>`.

:attr:`nvt_nhc`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the first parameter is :attr:`nvt_nhc`, it is similar to the case of :attr:`nvt_ber`, but using the :ref:`Nose-Hoover chain method <nose_hoover_chain_thermostat>`.

:attr:`nvt_bdp`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the first parameter is :attr:`nvt_bdp`, it is similar to the case of :attr:`nvt_ber`, but using the :ref:`Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello method <bdp_thermostat>`.

:attr:`nvt_lan`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the first parameter is :attr:`nvt_lan`, it is similar to the case of :attr:`nvt_ber`, but using the :ref:`Langevin method <langevin_thermostat>` as proposed in [Bussi2007a]_.

:attr:`nvt_bao`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the first parameter is :attr:`nvt_bao`, it is similar to the case of :attr:`nvt_ber`, but using the Langevin method with BAOAB splitting [Leimkuhler2013]_.

:attr:`npt_ber`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the first parameter is :attr:`npt_ber`, it means that the ensemble for the current run is NPT (isothermalâ€“isobaric) generated by using the :ref:`Berendsen barostat <berendsen_barostat>`.
In this case, apart from the same parameters as in the case of :attr:`nvt_ber`, one needs to further specify some target pressure(s), the same number of estimated elastic moduli, and a pressure coupling constant :attr:`p_coup`.
The general format is::

  ensemble npt_ber T_1 T_2 T_coup <pressure_control_parameters>

with three different options for specifying :attr:`<pressure_control_parameters>`:

* *Condition 1*: Cell shape updates are isotropic

  .. code::

     p_hydro C_hydro p_coup
    
  This means you regard your system as isotropic and want to control the three box lengths uniformly according to the hydrostatic pressure :attr:`p_hydro = (p_xx + p_yy + p_zz)/3`.
  All directions should have periodic boundary conditions.
  Currently, we require the box to be orthogonal.

* *Condition 2*: Cell shape updates are orthorhombic

  .. code::

     p_xx p_yy p_zz C_xx C_yy C_zz p_coup

  In this case, the simulation box must be orthogonal.
  The three box lengths will be controlled independently according to their respective target pressures.
  Any direction can be either periodic or nonperiodic and pressure controlling will only be effective in periodic directions.

* *Condition 3*: Cell shape updates are triclinic

  .. code::

     p_xx p_yy p_zz p_yz p_xz p_xy C_xx C_yy C_zz C_yz C_xz C_xy p_coup

  The simulation box must be triclinic and all the directions must be periodic.
  All cell components will be controlled independently according to the 6 target pressure components.

  It is sufficient for the elastic constant tensor :attr:`C_ab` to be a (very rough) estimate as long as it is of the right magnitude.
  It is used to convert the coupling constant (or relaxation time, see :ref:`here <choice_of_parameters>`) of the barostat into suitable internal units.

:attr:`npt_scr`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the first parameter is :attr:`npt_scr`, it is similar to the case of :attr:`npt_ber`, but using the :ref:`stochastic cell rescaling method <stochastic_cell_rescaling>`.

:attr:`heat_nhc`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the first parameter is :attr:`heat_nhc`, it means heating a source region and simultaneously cooling a sink region using local :ref:`Nose-Hoover chain thermostats <nose_hoover_chain_thermostat>`.
The full command is::

  ensemble heat_nhc T T_coup delta_T label_source label_sink

The target temperatures in the source region with label :attr:`label_source` and the sink region with label :attr:`label_sink` are :attr:`T+delta_T` and :attr:`T-delta_T`, respectively.
Therefore, the temperature difference between the two regions is two times :attr:`delta_T`.
In the command above, the parameter :attr:`T_coup` has the same meaning as in the case of :attr:`nvt_nhc`.
Both :attr:`label_source` and :attr:`label_sink` refer to the 0-th grouping method.

:attr:`heat_bdp`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the first parameter is :attr:`heat_bdp`, it is similar to the case of :attr:`heat_nhc`, but using the :ref:`Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello method <bdp_thermostat>`.

:attr:`heat_lan`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
if the first parameter is :attr:`heat_lan`, it is similar to the case of :attr:`heat_nhc`, but using the :ref:`Langevin method <langevin_thermostat>`.


.. _choice_of_parameters:

Units and suggested parameters
------------------------------

The units of temperature and pressure for this keyword are K and GPa, respectively. 

The temperature coupling constant :attr:`T_coup` means :math:`\tau_T/\Delta t`, where :math:`\tau_T` is the relaxation time of the thermostat and :math:`\Delta t` is the time step for integration.
We require :math:`\tau_T/\Delta t \geq 1` and a good choice is :math:`\tau_T/\Delta t \approx 100`.

The pressure coupling constant :attr:`p_coup` means :math:`\tau_p/\Delta t`, where :math:`\tau_p` is the relaxation time of the barostat and :math:`\Delta t` is the time step for integration.
We require :math:`\tau_p/\Delta t \geq 1` and a good choice is :math:`\tau_p/\Delta t \approx 1000`.

The elastic constants are in units of GPa.


Caveats
-------
One should use one and only one instance of this keyword for each :ref:`run keyword <kw_run>`.
