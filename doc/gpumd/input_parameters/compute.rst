   single: compute (keyword in run.in)

:attr:`compute`
===============

This keyword is used to compute and output space and time averaged quantities. 
The results are written to the :ref:`compute.out output file <compute_out>`.


Syntax
------
It is used in the following way::

  compute <grouping_method> <sample_interval> <output_interval> {<quantity>}

The first parameter :attr:`grouping_method` refers to the grouping method defined in the :ref:`simulation model file <model_xyz>`.
This parameter should be an integer and a number :math:`m` means the :math:`m`-th grouping method (we count from 0) in the :ref:`simulation model file <model_xyz>`.

The second parameter :attr:`sample_interval` means sampling the quantities every so many time steps.

The third parameter :attr:`output_interval` means averaging over so many sampled data before giving one output.

Starting from the fourth parameter, one can list the quantities to be computed.
The allowed names for :attr:`quantity` are:

* :attr:`temperature`, which yields the temperature
* :attr:`potential`, which yields the potential energy
* :attr:`force`, which yields the force vector
* :attr:`virial`, which yields all virial components 
* :attr:`jp`, which yields the potential part of the heat current vector
* :attr:`jk`, which yields the kinetic part of the heat current vector
* :attr:`momentum`, which yields the momentum

One can write one or more (distinct) names in any order.

Example
-------

For example::
  
  compute 0 100 10 temperature

means using the 0-th grouping method defined in the :ref:`simulation model file <model_xyz>`, sampling :attr:`temperature` every 100 time steps and averaging over 10 data points before writing to file.
That is, there is only one output every :math:`100 \times 10=1000` time steps.
