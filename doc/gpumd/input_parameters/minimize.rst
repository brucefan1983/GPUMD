   single: minimize (keyword in run.in)

:attr:`minimize`
================

This keyword is used to minimize the energy of the system.
Currently, the fast inertial relaxation engine (FIRE) [Bitzek2006]_ [Guénolé2020]_ method and the steepest descent (SD) method have been implemented.


Syntax
------

This keyword is used as follows::

  minimize <method> <force_tolerance> <maximal_number_of_steps> <box_change> <hydrostatic_strain>

Here,
:attr:`method` can be :attr:`sd` (the steepest descent method) or :attr:`fire` (the FIRE method).
:attr:`force_tolerance` is in units of eV/Å.
When the largest absolute force component among the :math:`3N` force components in the system is smaller than :attr:`force_tolerance`, the energy minimization process will stop even though the number of steps (interations) performed is smaller than :attr:`maximal_number_of_steps`.
:attr:`maximal_number_of_steps` is the maximal number of steps (interations) to be performed for the energy minimization process.
:attr:`box_change` specifies whether to optimize the box during minimization. It only supports the FIRE method now.
:attr:`hydrostatic_strain` indicates whether hydrostatic strain should be applied to change the box.

Examples
--------

Example 1
^^^^^^^^^
The command::

  minimize sd 1.0e-6 10000

means that one wants to do an energy minimization using the steepest descent method, with a force tolerance of :math:`10^{-6}` eV/Å for up to 10,000 steps.

Example 2
^^^^^^^^^
If you have no idea how small :attr:`force_tolerance` should be, you can simply asign a negative number to it::

  minimize sd -1 10000

In this case, the energy minimization process will definitely run 10,000 steps.

Example 3
^^^^^^^^^
The command::

  minimize fire 1.0e-5 1000

means that one wants to do an energy minimization using the FIRE method, with a force tolerance of :math:`10^{-5}` eV/Å for up to 1,000 steps.

Example 4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The command::

  minimize fire 1.0e-5 1000 1 

means that one wants to optimize box during the energy minimization process.

The command::

  minimize fire 1.0e-5 1000 1 1

means that one wants to optimize box using hydrostatic strain during the energy minimization process.

Example 5
^^^^^^^^^
If you want to ouput the optimized structure, use `dump_xyz` in the `nve` ensemble like the following command::

  minimize fire 1.0e-5 1000 1

  ensemble    nve
  time_step   0
  dump_xyz    -1 0 1 relaxed.xyz
  run         1

Caveats
-------

* This keyword should occur after the :ref:`potential keyword <kw_potential>`.
