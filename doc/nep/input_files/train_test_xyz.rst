``train.xyz`` and ``test.xyz``
==============================

The :attr:`train.xyz` file, which contains the training data for the construction of a :term:`NEP` model, and the :attr:`test.xyz` file, which contains the corresponding test data, both need to be provided in `extended xyz file format <https://github.com/libAtoms/extxyz>`_.
Each structure (or configuration or frame) occupies :math:`N+2` lines, where :math:`N` is the number of atoms in the structure.

Format for a single structure
-----------------------------

Line 1
^^^^^^
The first line should only contain one field, which is the number of atoms in the structure :math:`N`.

Line 2
^^^^^^

This line consists of a number of ``keyword=value`` pairs separated by spaces.
Spaces before and after ``=`` are allowed.
All the characters are case-insensitive.
``value`` can be a single item or a number of items enclosed by double quotes, such as ``keyword="value_1 value_2 value_3"``.
Here, the different values are separated by spaces and spaces after the left ``"`` and before the right ``"`` are allowed.
For example, one can write ``keyword=" value_1 value_2 value_3 "``.

Essentially any keyword is allowd, but we only read the following ones:

* :attr:`lattice="ax ay az bx by bz cx cy cz"` is mandatory and gives the cell vectors:

  .. math::
     
     \boldsymbol{a} &= a_x \boldsymbol{e}_x + a_y \boldsymbol{e}_y + a_z \boldsymbol{e}_z \\
     \boldsymbol{b} &= b_x \boldsymbol{e}_x + b_y \boldsymbol{e}_y + b_z \boldsymbol{e}_z \\
     \boldsymbol{c} &= c_x \boldsymbol{e}_x + c_y \boldsymbol{e}_y + c_z \boldsymbol{e}_z

* :attr:`energy=energy_value` such as :attr:`energy=-123.4` is mandatory and gives the target energy of the structure, which is :math:`-123.4` eV in this example.
* :attr:`virial="vxx vxy vxz vyx vyy vyz vzx vzy vzz"` is optional and gives the :math:`3\times3` virial tensor of the structure. 
* :attr:`weight=relative_weight` is optional and gives the relative weight for the current structure in the total loss function.
* :attr:`properties=property_name:data_type:number_of_columns` is mandatory but only read the following items:
  
  * :attr:`species:S:1` chemical symbol in the periodic table (case-sensitive)
  * :attr:`pos:R:3` position vector
  * :attr:`force:R:3` or :attr:`forces:R:3` target force vector

Starting from line 3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each line should contain the same number of items, which are determined by the :attr:`property` keywords on line 2.

Units
-----
* Length and position are expected in units of Ångstrom.
* The energy is expected  in units of eV.
* Forces are exepected is in units of eV/Å.
* Virials are expected in units of eV (such that th virial divided by the volume yields the stress).

Tips
----
* Periodic boundary conditions are always assumed for all directions in each configuration.
  When the box thickness in a direction is smaller than twice of the radial cutoff distance, the code will internally replicate the box in that direction.
* The minimal number of atoms in a configuration is 1.
  The user is responsible for choosing a sensible reference energy when preparing the energy data.
  But this is not crucial as the absolute energies are not relevant in the present context.
* The energy and virial data refer to the total energy and virial for the system.
  They are not per-atom but per-cell quantities.
