   single: save_potential (keyword in nep.in)

:attr:`save_potential`
======================

This keyword sets the number of of generations between writing a ``nep.txt`` checkpoint file.
If ``<format>`` is set to ``0`` the output file name is formatted as ``nep_gen[generation].txt``.
If ``<format>`` is set to ``1`` the output file name is formatted as ``nep_y[year]_m[month]_d[day]_h[hour]_m[minute]_s[second]_generation[generation].txt``.
These model files can be used to monitor the training progress of your model.
Note that the :ref:`nep.restart file <nep_restart>` is the file that is required to continue training.

The syntax is::

  save_potential <number_of_generations_between_save_potential> <format>

The default number of generations between saved model files is :math:`N=10^5` and the output file names use the extended format.
