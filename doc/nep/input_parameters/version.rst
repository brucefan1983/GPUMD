:attr:`version`
===============

This keyword selects which :term:`NEP` version should be used.
The syntax is::

  version <version_number>

Here, :attr:`<version_number>` must be an integer, which can be 2, 3, or 4, corresponding to NEP2, NEP3, and NEP4, respectively.
The default is 4.

More information about the :term:`NEP` formalism can be found :ref:`here <nep_formalism>`.
