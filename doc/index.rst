GPUMD -- Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics
*****************************************************

:program:`GPUMD` stands for *Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics*.
It is a general-purpose molecular dynamics (:term:`MD`) package fully implemented on graphics processing units (:term:`GPU`).
In addition to :ref:`several empirical interatomic potentials <potentials>`, it supports :ref:`neuroevolution potential <nep_formalism>` (:term:`NEP`) models.
:program:`GPUMD` also allows one to construct the latter type of models using the :ref:`nep executable <nep_executable>`.
