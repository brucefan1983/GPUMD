# `GPUMD`

## What is `GPUMD`?

* `GPUMD` stands for Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics. It is a general-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) code fully implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs). 
* Force evaluation for many-body potentials has been significantly accelerated by using GPUs [1], thanks to a set of simple expressions for force, virial stress, and heat current derived in Refs. [2, 3]. 
* Apart from being highly efficient, another unique feature of GPUMD is that it has useful utilities to study heat transport [2, 3, 4, 5].
* It can run MD simulations with the machine-learning based force constant potential (FCP) [6].
* It can train the NEP machine-learning potential [7, 8, 9] and run MD simulations with it. See this [nep-data Gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/brucefan1983/nep-data) for some of the published NEP potentials and the related training/testing data.

## Prerequisites

* You need to have a GPU card with compute capability no less than 3.5 and a `CUDA` toolkit no older than `CUDA` 9.0.
* Works for both Linux (with GCC) and Windows (with MSVC) operating systems. 

## Compile GPUMD
* Go to the `src` directory and type `make`. When the compilation finishes, two executables, `gpumd` and `nep`, will be generated in the `src` directory. 

## Run GPUMD
* Go to the directory of an example and type one of the following commands:
  * `path/to/gpumd`
  * `path/to/nep`

## Colab tutorial
* We provide a [Colab Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QnXAveZgzwut4Mvldsw-r2I0EWIsj1KA?usp=sharing) to show the workflow of the construction of a NEP model and its application in large-scale atomistic simulations for PbTe system. This will run entirely on Google's cloud virtual machine. You can also check other offline tutorials in the examples.
