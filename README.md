# `GPUMD`

## What is `GPUMD`?

* `GPUMD` stands for Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics. It is a general-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) code fully implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs). 
* Force evaluation for many-body potentials has been significantly accelerated by using GPUs [1], thanks to a set of simple expressions for force, virial stress, and heat current derived in Refs. [2, 3]. 
* Apart from being highly efficient, another unique feature of GPUMD is that it has useful utilities to study heat transport [2, 3, 4, 5].
* It can run MD simulations with the machine-learning based force constant potential (FCP) [6].
* It can train the NEP machine-learning potential [7, 8] and run MD simulations with it. See this [nep-data Gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/brucefan1983/nep-data) for all the published NEP potentials and the related training/testing data.

## Prerequisites

* You need to have a GPU card with compute capability no less than 3.5 and a `CUDA` toolkit no older than `CUDA` 9.0.
* Works for both Linux (with GCC) and Windows (with MSVC) operating systems. 

## Compile GPUMD
* Go to the `src` directory and type `make`. When the compilation finishes, two executables, `gpumd` and `nep`, will be generated in the `src` directory. 

## Run GPUMD
* See the `examples/readme.md` file.

## Manual
* We only maintain the online manual now: https://gpumd.zheyongfan.org

## Citations

### Mandatory citation for any work used GPUMD:
* If you use `GPUMD` in your published work, we kindly ask you to cite the following paper which describes the central algorithms used in `GPUMD`:

[1] Zheyong Fan, Wei Chen, Ville Vierimaa, and Ari Harju. Efficient molecular dynamics simulations with many-body potentials on graphics processing units. Computer Physics Communications **218**, 10 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2017.05.003

### Optional citation to the code repository:
* If you want to cite a link to the GPUMD code you can cite the current Github page: https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD. 
* However, if the journal does not accept this citation, you can check the Zenodo page of GPUMD (https://zenodo.org/record/4037256#.X2jkqWj7SUk) and cite the version you used. Each version has a unique DOI, which is very suitable for citation. **Remember to change the author list to Zheyong Fan and Alexander J. Gabourie.**
